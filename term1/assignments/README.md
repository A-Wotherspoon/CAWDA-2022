### Q1.

Markup languages can be defined as a notation method of how particular pieces of information are to be displayed and formatted. In the context of web development, markup languages refer to a language with a specific set of rules that govern the appearance of a document. This differs to programming languages which are instead designed as a special set of instructions which can transform data via interacting with the computer's CPU.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the most commonly used markup language on the Web, where its main feature is the use of tags and elements to define the structure and formatting of the web document's contents. These tags and elements are defined within "<" and ">", where any text written within these characters are considered as part of the markup language instructing how the document should look, and not part of the displayed text.
