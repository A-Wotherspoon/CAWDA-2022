## Q1.

Markup languages can be defined as a notation method of how particular pieces of information are to be displayed and formatted. In the context of web development, markup languages refer to a language with a specific set of rules that govern the appearance of a document. This differs to programming languages as no logic or processing of data are performed.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the most commonly used markup language on the Web, where its main feature is the use of tags and elements to define the structure and formatting of the web document's contents. These tags and elements are defined within opening "<" and closing ">" tags, where any text written within these characters are considered as part of the markup language instructing how the document should look, and not part of the displayed text.

A number of key elements are defined below, with HTML examples included:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Document type declaration</b>: Contained in the very first line of the document, this is an instruction to the document reader about what type of document to expect. In HTML documents, this is defined via the &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt declaration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Root element</b>: A container element which acts as a parent for all other elements on the page of the document. In HTML documents, all other elements are contained within the &ltHTML&gt&lt/HTML&gt tags.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Head</b>: A section where metadata about the document is included, containing information such as title, other referenced sheets or assets, and information to aid reading compatibility. In HTML, this is enclosed within the &lthead&gt&lt/head&gt tags.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Body</b>: Where the main content of the document that is to be displayed is included, such as all text and images. In a HTML document, the content is contained within the &ltbody&gt&lt/body&gt tags.
    </li>
</ul>
